# Classes

## Intro 

This exercise will rehash on the old exercise from manipulation, building on that juicy refreshed knowledge,
we will move on to the heavier stuff, **PHP Classes**.

This chapter can get a little heavier / more difficult, but stick with it and you'll learn a lot...



### Setup
1. Create a repository `Blackjack`
1. Follow the instructions step by step: commit & push at the end of every step.
1. When the instruction starts with README, write whatâ€™s asked in the README of your repository.
1. Create home.php.

### Blackjack Rules
- Cards are between 1-11 points.
- Getting more than 21 points, means that you lose.
- Getting 21 points with your first two cards, means you have a blackjack.
- To win, you need to have more points than the dealer, but not more than 21.
- The dealer is obligated to keep taking cards until they have at least 15 points.

### Instructions
1. Create a class called `Blackjack` in the file `blackjack.php`.
1. Add three methods to this class: 
	- `Hit`
	- `Stand`
	- `Surrender`
1. `Hit` should add a card between 1-11.
1. `Stand` should end your turn and start the dealer's turn. (Your point total is saved.)
1. `Surrender` should make you surrender the game. (Dealer wins.)
1. Add a property to this class called `score`. This property should have the value of the player's score at all times.
1. Instantiate the class twice, once for the player and once for the dealer.
1. Create a button on home.php that starts the game when pushed, it should go to game.php.
1. On `game.php` instantiate the Blackjack class twice, insert it into a `player` variable and a `dealer` variable
1. Save these instances in the session (you're gonna need them)
1. Use forms to send to the `game.php` page what the player's action is. (i.e. hit/stand/surrender)
1. Use the class' methods to react to these actions.
1. The final result should be the following:
    - When you `hit` the server should draw a card between 1-11, and add it to your total score. 
    - If you reach >21, then the page should tell you you lost. 
    - If you stand before that, the dealer starts drawing cards until he reaches >15. 
    - The server then needs to check the difference between your result and that of the dealer. 
    - The person with the biggest score (that is still lower than 22) wins the hand (If equal the dealer wins). 
    - As a final option: at any point you need to be able to click `surrender` after which the page tells you you lost and simulates the dealer's score.


> This concludes the PHP training, this is a good intro into php coding. Make sure you understand what a class is, what you just did and if you do, you are ready to move on to 
advanced JS coding.

> We will delve more in depth on PHP code once we choose backend / frontend.<br/>
For now this is enough.
